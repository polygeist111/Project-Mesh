# Mesh CI

---

## Pipeline Flow

The CI pipeline behaves as follows:

1. run Prettier on web-related filetypes, as well as XML
   a. Do not use prettier-plugin-kotlin, it is not maintained and errors regularly
2. On push, run super-linter. For all possible cases, run autofix (this covers Kotlin)

- Needs updating

## To Do

### Sprint 5

- For all workflows, add current build summary as commit/pr comments
- Alter system to use GitHub Pages instead of github HTML preview. This will fix CSS on previews
  - Add script to change iFrame title and onscreen title + pass/fail indicator
- Add orchestrator workflow for all reporting tasks
  - determine how to allow multiple reusable workflows to share build cache
  - add link to super-linter actions output
  - onsider whether to delete reports files after use
  - add setting on manual run whether to commit anything/deploy to pages

### Backlog

- Integrate with Dokka
- Test auto UML diagramming
- Break workflows out into multiple intelligently-grouped jobs for improved execution visibility
