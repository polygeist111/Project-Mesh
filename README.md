New version by wil-mesh-rmit

Project Mesh runs locally on an android device. Build the project then either export the APK and send to the device, or use ADB to install. The app only works on physical devices, and not the android simulator.

1. Open the app
2. When prompted, allow location and nearby devices permissions
3. Wait for a QR code to appear on screen
4. On each phone, use the ‘Scan QR code’ button to scan the codes of adjacent devices
5. Messages are able to be sent to connected devices with the ‘Send’ button and ‘Message’ text box
